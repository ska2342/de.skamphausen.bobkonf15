========================

Talk for [BOB Konference](http://bobkonf.de/2015/#) in Berlin, January
2015

# Language

This README may be written in English, the talk is in German, though.

# Content

This talk is about Clojures Implementation of Software Transactional
Memory, STM.  It describes how a series of design choices for Clojure
itself allow the implementation of STM.  Examples to introduce the
usage of Refs and STM and some examples examining how STM works and
some subtle intricacies are provided.

# Technology

I wrote some CLojure code to run a presentation powered by
[reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) from a
[ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/) web-server.  While it
was fun writing it and it is a new idea at least for me, it was not
particularly fun to actually use it.
